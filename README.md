This is Legacy Maplestory Helper. Use at your own risk of getting banned since this helper has auto-attack and key presser built-in.

Writer's note: Helper uses computer vision (heavily dependent on OpenCV libraries) to detect character's position as well as HP bar/MP bar. One can reverse-engineer and find the address / pointer (which is easier than computer vision for this game) to do similar tasks as this helper. However, for learning purposes, I have chosen OpenCV as my area to expand on writing this helper.

Demo photo below was at very early stage of the helper. Helper has other "help" functions that lie within the code.
